wallp is a command line utility to download and set wallpapers. It works on Linux(Gnome / KDE Plasma) and on Windows. It can select images from a variety of sources on the Internet. 

Following is the list of sources it currently supports:

* reddit
* bing
* google
* deviantart
* imgur

Also, it can generate single color bitmaps as wallpapers.

By default, whenever it's run, it selects a source at random, selects a random image from the source, downloads it and sets it as a wallpaper.
